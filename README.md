# Home Credit Default Risk Analysis

**Predictive modeling project for loan default risk assessment**

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict loan default risk for Home Credit Group. Using historical loan application data and supplementary credit history, we build a classifier to identify clients likely to default, enabling better lending decisions and reduced financial losses.

### Business Problem
Home Credit aims to predict which clients are likely to default on their loans. Default is a rare event (~8% of loans), creating a highly imbalanced classification problem requiring specialized modeling approaches.

### Key Metrics
- **Primary:** ROC-AUC Score (accounts for class imbalance)
- **Secondary:** Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Business Impact:** Reduction in default losses while maintaining approval rates

## 🎯 Key Findings from EDA

### Data Quality
- **Overall Quality Score:** 91.8/100 (Excellent)
- **Missing Data:** 2.26% overall (manageable)
- **Class Imbalance:** 91.96% repaid vs 8.04% defaulted (11.39:1 ratio)
- **Data Issues:** Fixed DAYS_EMPLOYED anomaly (365,243 placeholder value)

### Strongest Predictors
1. **Employment Stability** (DAYS_EMPLOYED: r = -0.065)
2. **Client Age** (older clients = lower risk)
3. **Income Level** (higher income = protective)
4. **Credit Affordability** (loan size relative to income)
5. **External Credit Scores** (EXT_SOURCE variables)

### Critical Insights
- Baseline accuracy of 91.96% is misleading due to class imbalance
- Must use ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, and F1-Score for evaluation
- Weak individual correlations (|r| < 0.08) indicate need for multivariate models
- Supplementary data (bureau history, payment patterns) will significantly improve predictions

## 📈 Expected Model Performance

Based on comprehensive feature engineering:

| Model Type | Expected ROC-AUC | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Baseline (majority class) | 0.50 | Random guessing |
| Simple Logistic Regression | 0.60-0.65 | Basic model |
| XGBoost (application data) | 0.70-0.75 | Good model |
| **XGBoost + engineered features** | **0.76-0.82** | **Strong model** |
| Optimized ensemble | 0.83+ | Excellent model |

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Encode Categorical Variables
```python
categorical_cols = ['AGE_GROUP', 'INCOME_GROUP', 'CREDIT_GROUP', 
                   'NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE', 'CODE_GENDER', etc.]
# Use one-hot encoding or label encoding as appropriate
```

### 2. Model Training (Recommended Approach)
```python
import xgboost as xgb

# XGBoost handles class imbalance well
model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    max_depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.01,
    n_estimators=1000,
    scale_pos_weight=11.39,  # Handle 11.39:1 imbalance
    eval_metric='auc',
    random_state=42
)

model.fit(X_train, y_train,
         eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)],
         early_stopping_rounds=50)
```

### 3. Handle Class Imbalance
- Use `scale_pos_weight=11.39` in XGBoost
- Or use `class_weight='balanced'` in sklearn models
- Consider SMOTE oversampling if needed

### 4. Evaluation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, classification_report

y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_val)[:, 1]
auc = roc_auc_score(y_val, y_pred_proba)
print(f"ROC-AUC: {auc:.4f}")
```

## 🔍 Key Technical Decisions

### Why These Features?
1. **Financial Ratios:** Capture affordability and debt burden (critical for credit risk)
2. **Bureau Aggregates:** Historical payment behavior is the strongest default predictor
3. **Missing Indicators:** Missingness patterns are often predictive (e.g., no bureau history = first-time borrower)
4. **Interaction Terms:** Capture non-linear relationships (e.g., age + income interaction)
5. **Binned Variables:** Create non-linear boundaries and categorical segments

### Why XGBoost?
- Handles missing values naturally
- Robust to outliers
- Captures complex non-linear relationships
- Excellent with imbalanced data (via scale_pos_weight)
- Provides feature importance for interpretability

### Train/Test Consistency
All imputation values, binning thresholds, and transformation parameters are computed from **training data only** and applied consistently to test data. This prevents data leakage and ensures valid model evaluation.

## 🤖 Model Development & Results

### Modeling Notebook
**`model_development.ipynb`** - Comprehensive model development and evaluation

This notebook systematically develops and compares multiple machine learning models for predicting loan default risk.

### Models Evaluated

We compared four model types using 3-fold cross-validation on ROC-AUC:

| Model | ROC-AUC | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Baseline (Majority Class) | 0.500 | Always predicts no default - demonstrates why accuracy is misleading |
| Logistic Regression | 0.681 | Simple baseline with class weights |
| Random Forest | 0.738 | Good performance with 100 trees |
| XGBoost | 0.766 | Strong performance with scale_pos_weight |
| **LightGBM (Final)** | **0.778** | **Best performance - selected as final model** |

### Class Imbalance Strategy

With an 11.39:1 imbalance ratio (91.96% repaid vs 8.04% default), we tested five approaches:

1. **No adjustment** - Baseline (0.735 AUC)
2. **Class weights (scale_pos_weight)** - **Best approach** (0.778 AUC) ✓
3. SMOTE oversampling - Mixed results (0.741 AUC)
4. Random undersampling - Data loss issues (0.712 AUC)
5. Hybrid (SMOTE + undersampling) - Moderate (0.734 AUC)

**Winner:** Simple class weights provided the best results without data loss or complexity.

### Why LightGBM Was Selected

Our final model is **LightGBM with optimized hyperparameters** for several reasons:

1. **Best Performance:** Highest ROC-AUC (0.778) among all models tested
2. **Handles Imbalance Well:** scale_pos_weight parameter effectively addresses 11.39:1 imbalance
3. **Feature Importance:** Provides interpretable feature importances for business insights
4. **Computational Efficiency:** Faster training than XGBoost on large datasets
5. **Robust to Overfitting:** Built-in regularization prevents overfitting

### Hyperparameter Tuning

9. **ANNUITY_INCOME_RATIO** (Debt service ratio) - 0.035 importance
10. **BUREAU_DEBT_CREDIT_RATIO** (Current debt burden) - 0.032 importance

### Impact of Supplementary Features

Comparison shows supplementary data (bureau, previous applications, installments) provides significant value:

- **Application features only:** 0.702 AUC
- **With supplementary features:** 0.778 AUC
- **Improvement:** +0.076 AUC (+10.8% lift)

**Conclusion:** Bureau payment history and previous application patterns are critical for accurate default prediction.

### Computational Strategy

To manage computation time while maintaining model quality:
